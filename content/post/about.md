My hobbies are painting, and software development..
I'm retired (was a nuclear/mechanical and software engineer) and live near Horsham in West Sussex, UK. I studied at Queen Mary College, London, Imperial College, and University of Californa, Berkeley. I'm also old.

My painting above is of one of my granddaughters.

I paint in oils, attempting representational art (i.e. things that are recognisable, in contrast to abstract art). If you would like to buy one of my pictures, let me know.  Commissions and requests are welcome (see below). Email me directly:

I am a member (and currently the Secretary) of [**Horsham Artists**](https://www.horshamartists.org) who have 3 exhibitions each year in Horsham (**Art Trail** in June, **Art Fair** around October and the **Christmas Market** in Nov/Dec. I've taken part in the Trail and Fair.

## Software Interests

I have developed a **Web app** using Dart and Flutter. 

- **BoardsUp!** is for planning temporary (and permanent) art exhibitions, especially those that hire temporary, movable walls/boards on which 2D is art is hung. I'll create a link here when it's ready.

- another web app in the pipeline!

## Art Interests

I have recently been working on (= trying to improve) portraits, but I'm starting to enjoy still lifes. They're tricky too. I'll see.

## Commissions  

**No risk**... apart from a small upfront fee, you will not be committed to purchasing the picture eg if you don't like it.

If you're local (South East England), I'd prefer to take reference photos of your subject myself.  But if you have a good photo you can email me, I might be able to work from that (but no guarantees).

## Requests

Other than personal commissions, I'm happy to paint a request if it looks interesting eg request "a still life with a black dog and roses, 50x50cm". Email me a request. I would let you know if/when it's done, and you decide then if you want to buy it. If not, I'll just add it to my collection. It will have been fun anyway.

## Materials and Resources

I use the following materials:

## Gesso 

- Usually Michael Harding non-absorbent gesso
- Grounds - Wallace Seymour Professional Oil ground;  Rublev Lead Oil ground;  Rublev Lead Alkyd ground;

## Paints 

- Michael Harding and Rublev oil paints. I get most from The Supreme Paint Company

## Canvases

- stretched linen and stretched cotton from eg Jacksons Art 
- stretched polyester from ACF Canvases (no gesso required, just ground)
- ACM (aluminium composite) from eg Cut Plastic Sheeting (either a gesso or ground)


## Brushes 

- [*Rosemary's Brushes*](https://www.rosemaryandco.com/)
