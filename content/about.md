Steve Lympany

2026

My hobbies are painting, and software development. 
I'm a retired engineer and live near Horsham in West Sussex, UK. I studied at Queen Mary College, London, Imperial College, and University of Californa, Berkeley. 

I'm old.

I paint in oils (sometimes I do charcoal drawings) attempting representational art (i.e. things that are recognisable, in contrast to abstract art). If you would like to buy one of my pictures, let me know.  **Commissions** and **requests** are welcome (see below). Email me directly: _**lympanyArt AT pm.me**_ (Of course, replace " AT " with "@"). 

I am a member (and currently the Secretary) of [**Horsham Artists**](https://www.horshamartists.org) (HA) which has 3 exhibitions each year in Horsham : **Art Trail** in June, **Art Fair** around October and the **Christmas Market** in Nov/Dec. HA also has an annual workshop **Art For Wellbeing** (28 Feb & 1 Mar 2026). Check [**EventBrite**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/) to book a place, with workshops by other artists from HA too.

### **Software Interests**

I have developed apps for the web (browsers) and Windows using Dart and Flutter. Contact me if any are of interest (it would be free)...
- A Windows app **BoardsUp!** for planning temporary (and permanent) art exhibitions, especially those that hire temporary, movable walls/boards on which 2D is art is hung. 
- a web app [**TATOE**](https://tatoe.co.uk/) for managing Art Trails.
- a Windows app **PicFramer2** to put a frame around an image of a picture of artwork, for upload to websites. 

### **Art Interests** 

I strive to improve my painting - portraiture, still lifes, street scenes and landscapes, and experiment with new styles. I am not sure I have a style!

### **Commissions**  

**No risk**... apart from a small upfront fee to cover materials, you will not be committed to purchasing the picture - even if you simply don't like it or just change your mind.

If you live near me (West Sussex, South East England), I prefer to take reference photos of your subject myself.  But if you have a good photo you can email me, I might be able to work from that (but no guarantees).

I can do copies of pictures (here on my wesbite) that are marked as "unavailable", if you wish.

### **Requests**

Other than personal commissions, I'm happy to paint **a request** with **no deposit**, if it looks interesting e.g. request *a still life of a black dog and roses, 50x50cm*. Just email me. I would let you know if/when it's done, and then you decide if you want to buy it. If not, I'll just add it to my collection. It will have been fun anyway.

Clearly I cannot do a request for a commission (I wouldn't be able to sell it if you did not want it, because it would be personal to you).

### **Materials and Resources**

A brief note - I don't get paid by any of my "plugs" below. They're all my own views from experience.

I use the following materials:

### **Gesso** 

- Gesso: _**Michael Harding**_ non-absorbent gesso
- Grounds: _**Rublev Lead Oil**_ ground; 
_**Wallace Seymour**_ Professional Oil ground; 
_**Rublev Lead Alkyd**_ ground (not so often now. Alkyds gunk up in the can if left too long)

### **Paints** 

- _**Michael Harding**_ and _**Rublev oil**_ paints by [Natural Pigments](https://www.naturalpigments.eu/). I buy most from *[The Supreme Paint Company](https://www.supremepaint.co.uk/)* which has a lovely and informative website and good delivery 👍
- informative videos on paints, mediums etc (by [Natural Pigments](https://www.naturalpigments.eu/))  

    * https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr-fcElY8HHtbOgST8__9Vg 
    * https://www.youtube.com/@RublevColours  **Very good**!

### **Canvases**

- _**ACM**_ (aluminium composite) from eg [here](https://www.cutplasticsheeting.co.uk/product/brushed-aluminium-silver-butler-composite-panel/). Good prices. Use either a gesso or ground.
- _**stretched polyester**_ from *[ACFCanvases](https://acfcanvasses.com/)*. A bit different to use, but good. Excellent for detailed work. They don't need to be gessoed, but I usually do.
- _**stretched linen**_ and stretched cotton from eg [Jackson's](https://www.jacksonsart.com/). I don't use cotton much these days.


### **Brushes** 

- [*Rosemary's Brushes*](https://www.rosemaryandco.com/) Who else?!

### **How to paint**
